# Serving

The core idea behind the 'serving' component is to provide a user (data scientist) with an easy-to-use tool for deploying and managing deployed ML models.

Kubeflow itself doesn't provide a toolkit for serving. We want to add a service that lets a user deploy a model that one's trained using KFP (pipelines).
